# Event Plataform

This project is an events platform developed during the Ignite Lab 1 promoted by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

I have included various modifications to the base project developed for a better development experience.

## Technologies

-   Vite
-   TypeScript
-   React (v18)
-   Eslint
-   Prettier
-   Aliases TypeScript support

## How to use it?

Execute with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
yarn create next-app --example=https://github.com/SeltikHD/nextjs-typescript-app
# or
git clone https://github.com/SeltikHD/nextjs-typescript-app.git
```

After running these commands, run:

```bash
cd event-plataform
yarn install

```

**All dependencies are already pre-configured**, to change the settings, look at the wiki of each dependency.
